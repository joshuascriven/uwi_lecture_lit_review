- I know about Nuclear weapons:
- The first fission bombs were dropped by the Allied forces in WWII in the Pacific conflict with Japan
- I know that many people at the time were convinced of the necessity of the bombs
- I know that many people today are opposed to the use of such weapons of mass and indiscriminate destruction

#.fsize75[Research Question]




# .fsize105[.or1[**Define**] | .bluelight[Refine]]


You need to begin a literature review with a clearly defined,well-focused research question and a plan. A good review topic should be in the form of a research question. 
<!-- For example, “divorce” or “crime” is much too broad. A more appropriate review topic might be “What contributes to the stability of families with stepchildren?” or “Does economic inequality produce crime rates across nations?”
 -->Often, a researcher will not finalize a specific research question for a study until he or she has reviewed the literature. 
The review usually helps to focus on the research question.

Bring up operationalization

After choosing a focused research question for the review, the next step is to plan a search strategy. You must decide on the type of review, its extensiveness, and the types of materials to include. The key is to be careful, systematic, and organized. Set parameters on your search: how much time you will devote to it, how far back in time you will look, the minimum number of research

135 HOW TO REVIEW THE LITERATURE AND CONDUCT ETHICAL STUDIES

reports you will examine, how many libraries you will visit, and so forth.

Also decide how to record the bibliographic citation for each reference and how to take notes (e.g., in a notebook, on 3"  5" cards, in a computer file). You should begin a file folder or computer file in which you can place possible sources and ideas for new sources. As your review proceeds, you should more narrowly focus on a specific research question or issue.

The Advantages.

1. The Internet is easy, fast, and cheap. It is widely accessible, and can be used from many locations. This nearly free resource allows people to find source material from almost anywhere: local public libraries,homes,labs or classrooms,coffee shops,

or anywhere a computer can connect to the Internet. It operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. With minimal training, most people can quickly perform searches and get information that a few years ago would have required them to take a trip to large research libraries. Searching a vast quantity of information electronically is easier and faster than a manual search. The Internet greatly expands the amount and variety of source material. In addition, once the information is located, a researcher can often store it electronically or print it at a local site.

2. The Internet has “links” that provide additional ways to find and connect to other sources of information. Web sites, home pages, and other Internet resource pages have links that can call up information from related sites or sources simply by clicking on the link indicator (usually a button or a highlighted word or phrase). This connects the user to more information and provides access to cross-referenced material. Links embed one source within a network of related sources.

3. The Internet greatly speeds the flow of information around the globe and has a “democratizing” effect. It provides rapid transmission of information (e.g., text, news, data, and photos) across long distances and national borders. Accessing some reports 10 years ago required waiting a week or month and spending some money; today you obtain them within seconds at no cost. Almost no restrictions limit who puts material on the Internet or what appears on it. This means that people who had difficulty publishing or disseminating materials can now do so with ease. Because of its openness, the Internet reinforces the norm of universalism.

4. The Internet provides access to a vast range of information sources, some in formats that are quite dynamic and interesting. You can access a report in black-and-white text, as in traditional academic journals and sources, or with bright colors, graphics, moving images, photos, and even audio and video clips. Authors and other creators of information can be creative in their presentations.

The Disadvantages.

1. There is no quality control over what can be put on the Internet. Unlike standard academic
